# Pandemic Simulation

I wrote some code to try and mimic what happens in a pandemic.

For a given population size, reproduction rate and initial number of active cases, the script simulated the pandemic and outputs a graph of how the number of infected changes over time and also the total number of people who will become infected over time (supposing that everyone can only become infected once then the virus will eventually die out because herd immunity will be established).

Code was written in R 4.0.
